my typst template. It's alright.

## Features
- title, Subtitle, Author
- outline (for now only for headers), modified from some code kindly donated by [xkevio](https://github.com/xkevio), i'll have to change this using `outline.entry`.
- theorems, using a slightly modified version of [typst-theorems](https://github.com/sahasatvik/typst-theorems). I still have to work on this for easier use.

## To Do
- organize stuff
- add options
- make theorems interact between them more nicely
- abstract (I don't know how I forgot about this)
- remake outline using `outline.entry` (thank's for the suggestion [xkevio](https://github.com/xkevio))
- LaTeX inspired `part` thing?
