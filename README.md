my typst template. it's alright.

## Features
- title, Subtitle, Author
- outline (for now only for headers), modified from some code kindly donated by [xkevio](https://github.com/xkevio), i'll have to change this using `outline.entry`.
- theorems, using a slightly modified version of [typst-theorems](https://github.com/sahasatvik/typst-theorems). I still have to work on this for easier use.

## How To
pls look at the example.

## To Do
- [ ] organize stuff
- [ ] add options
- [ ] make theorems interact between them more nicely
- [ ] abstract (I don't know how I forgot about this)
- [ ] remake outline using `outline.entry` (thanks for the suggestion [xkevio](https://github.com/xkevio))
- [ ] LaTeX inspired `part` thing?
- [ ] bibliography (i want to style it differently but typst doesnt allow that yet)
